## Welcome!

\o/

First and foremost, Welkom! Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue!

Thank you for visiting the SugahFinder :candy: project repository.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

* You really like to live your life to the fullest, taking in all perks of 'the good life', but money keeps getting in your way.
* You dream of nice stuff, expensive cars, nice clothes and jewelry, eating-out whenever possible, but money keeps getting in your way.
* You kinda suck at life, and need the money, free of charge.
* You like to feel important, be the center of someones attention, preferably this is expressed in the form of gifts and presents, but it's not happening, what are you doing wrong?

So, this is a real issue..how do you get the money and the stuff, without actually earning the money in the first place, just to be honest, you kinda suck.. We mean, who wants to go out into the world and get a job? right? There has to be an easy solution to get your life where you want it, with all the stuff you want, without leaving your couch. An app maybe? (answer: yes! its SugahFinder :custard:)

### The solution

The SugahFinder :lollipop: app will:

* Get you the sugar (mom or dad) you need so badly.
* Let you choose the specific flavour of sugar you want, maybe you're more into daily gifts, or maybe you just want that single new Lamborghini? We will find you a suitable goldmine :sparkles:.
* All jokes aside, we show you how an algorithm that sorts and labels people as it (we) see fit, can take a filantropist and turn them into a holy sweet mother of sugardaddies. Also be carefull what data you share with the world. We can rate your sweetness before you can say "Sugar!" :cookie:


## Who are we?

The founders of the Golddigger's Guide to Venmo - [Arthur][link_Arthur], [Rutger][link_Rutger], [Dick][link_Dick] and [Jay][link_Jay] - are peers currently starting their coding careers at the incredible learning environment that is also a school [Codam][link_Codam].

The development of this app is mentored by the team behind the [Creep-a-thon][link_creepathon] - a challenge launched in December 2020 by [Codam][link_Codam] and [Mozilla Foundation][link_Mozilla].

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help the project forward. 

At the moment the project is still in its infancy, we need to decide on what criteria relate to having a good (or bad) sugah-rating.
In other words our analysis of Venmos' dataset is rudimentary at the moment of creating this document.

We'd love to receive your feedback, and of course and again, all input is highly apprecieated.

Our primary goal is to shed light on systems that allow for and even encourage (Venmo!!) public sharing of private, possibly sensative information. Also we tried to show that using buzzwords, and invoking computer 'magic' is completely arbitrary. Labeling or grouping people based on so called data-analysis can create the image or idea of a robust and trustworthy system while that might not be the case at all.

## Contact us

If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement we'd love for you to [open an issue](../../issues) at this github repository because then we can get right on it. But you can also contact [Dick][link_Dick] or by emailing us (marvin@codam.nl).

You can also hang out, ask questions and share stories in the on [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/GG-to-venmo/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/GG-to-venmo/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) Gitter.

## Thank you

Thank you so much (Dankjewel! Danke sch√∂n! Merci beaucoup!) for visiting the project and we do hope that you'll join our effort to joining sweet-tooths with their favorite sugah.
